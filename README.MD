# .Net 3DS Toolkit
.Net 3DS Toolkit is a code library intended to simplify extracting and rebuilding 3DS ROMs.

It is currently being rewritten in .Net Core 2.2 (and .Net Standard 2.1 once it's out). Please see the Old folder for the original source and details.

Current features:
* Extract decrypted CCI files
* Extract decrypted CIA files
* Extract decrypted CXI files
* Extract & Rebuild decrypted RomFS files
* Extract & Rebuild decrypted ExeFS files
* Allow reading data of individual files for all above formats without extraction

Planned features:
* Console interface
* GUI
* Build ROMs
